# React & Tailwind Assignment: Interactive Dashboard

## Objective
Create a responsive dashboard using React and Tailwind CSS that displays various data visualizations and includes interactive components. The project should demonstrate proficiency in React, Tailwind CSS, state management, and version control.

## Requirements

### 1. Dashboard Layout
- Create a responsive layout with a sidebar and main content area
- Implement a collapsible sidebar for mobile views
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling

### 2. Data Visualizations
- Implement at least three different types of charts (e.g., line chart, bar chart, pie chart) using a charting library of your choice (e.g., Recharts, Chart.js)
- Make the charts responsive and interactive (e.g., show tooltips on hover)

### 3. Interactive Components
- Create a data table with sorting and filtering capabilities
- Implement a search functionality that filters data across all components
- Add a date range picker that updates the displayed data

### 4. State Management
- Use React hooks for local state management
- Implement context API or Redux for global state management

### 5. API Integration
- Fetch data from a mock API (you can use tools like json-server or Mirage JS to create a mock backend)
- Implement error handling and loading states

### 6. Performance Optimization
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading for dashboard components
- Optimize render performance using React.memo or useMemo where appropriate

### 7. Testing
- Write unit tests for key components using Jest and React Testing Library
- Achieve at least 70% test coverage

### 8. Version Control
- Use Git for version control
- Create a well-structured Git history with meaningful commit messages
- Implement feature branching and pull requests

### 9. Documentation
- Provide a README.md file with clear instructions on how to set up and run the project
- Include inline code comments explaining complex logic or implementations

## Bonus Points
- Implement a dark mode toggle using Tailwind CSS
- Add animations and transitions to enhance user experience
- Create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar tools

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and organization
- Effective use of React hooks and Tailwind CSS
- Responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility
- User experience and interface design
- Test coverage and quality
- Git commit history and branch management
- Documentation clarity

## Submission
- Provide a link to the GitHub repository containing your project
- Include a live demo link (e.g., hosted on Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages)
- Submit a brief write-up explaining your approach, challenges faced, and how you overcame them

Good luck!
